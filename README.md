# Todo List App

A simple Todo List application built using React. This application (was supposed to ) support dynamic light/dark themes based on the user's system preferences. Users can add, edit, complete, and delete tasks. The app also includes a kebab menu (three dots) for editing and deleting tasks, with smooth transitions and (Err, Still working on this one, need some coffee, BRB !!) accessibility features like keyboard shortcuts for closing the menu.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Edit Todos**: Users can edit a todo by clicking on the "Edit" option in the kebab menu.
- **Complete Todos**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **Delete Todos**: Users can delete a todo from the list.
- **Dynamic Theme**: Automatically switches between light and dark mode based on the system's theme preference.
- **Accessibility**: Close the kebab menu by pressing the `ESC` key or clicking anywhere outside the menu.

## Upcoming feature - Pop-up delete confirmation
